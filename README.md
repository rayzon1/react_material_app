## Project Description

  This project is for fsjs unit 07. In this project I communicated with Flickr's free api in order to provide a search for users of my site. It will search for the latest uploaded images using the keywords provided. In the site itself I have given the user the ability to switch between pages with pagination links. There is also a clear button provided during search results to clear results and navigate to the main page.
  
## CSS Styles

  For this project I decided to use my own styling for the site, instead of using the provided css from Treehouse. I did get pre-approval to do this.
